This manual is created with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and
[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

_MkDocs_ translates _Markdown_ files to static HTML.

The translation is controlled by the file _mkdocs.yml_.

To build or update the user manual, run the command:

```shell
mkdocs build
```
